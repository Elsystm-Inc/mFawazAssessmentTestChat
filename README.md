Chat App Task.

## Getting Started

2- The second task will measure your ability to integrate flutter with Firebase, work with push notifications, real-time databases, local databases, and caching methods.
You will be required to make a real-time chat application using the Firebase project that we have sent you an invitation on.

The chat app is expected to have a login screen using Firebase Auth after, logged in users can see every registered user and their current state online or offline.
User chat is saved locally to reduce loading times on the next retrival.
The user receives a push notification in case of a new message is being received. "Firebase functions will be used on this task, you can use someone else code to write this function because functions are not something that a mobile developer should write, you can find many examples to integrate push notifications with functions on the internet."
Bonus: The user can upload a photo for his account, photo uploading can be in the register screen or user settings screen.
You're free to design this app however you like.
